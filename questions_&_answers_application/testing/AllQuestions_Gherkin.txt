Feature: View a list of your Questions or posts


As a user, I want to  be able to view a list of all posts and questions that I have made.


Scenario: As a user, I want to view all of the available questions from the homepage
                GIVEN I am on the homepage after logging in or registering
                WHEN I select the “All Questions” tab 
                THEN I am taken to the <user’s> “All Questions” page
                AND I should see a search bar
                AND I can see each Question’s “Title”
                AND I can see each Question’s “Date”
                AND I can see whether each Question has been answered or not
