ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND PLANS TO ADDRESS THEM
* Attach Images to a post: To prevent users from seeing inappropriate images we would create a system for users to report inappropriate images.  We would also create a system for the user that attached the image to be able to tag their image as graphic and would add an extra setting for everyone to choose to have graphic images hidden or visible.
* Create/edit  question or post-To prevent inappropriate words from being used we would create a filter preventing inappropriate words from being used in posts. We would also  create a form to report posts that contain inappropriate text and images 
* Register a user- To prevent the creation of false accounts, we would include a verification process when a user registers a new account.
* Ability to upvote and downvote questions and answers- To prevent invalid upvotes and downvotes, we would create a system. (i.e. group attacking a user) 
* Reporting a user for attack -  To prevent the spread of malicious intent, attacking a user, or attacking a post, we would create a system to report users that may be doing this.

MAJOR CHANGES, THEIR IMPACT, AND HOW THEY WERE ADDRESSED


* One major challenge we had was collaborating on GitHub and learning how to properly push, pull, branch, and merge our changes without losing anything.
   * We mitigated this challenge by using the Git Cheatsheet on Canvas and Googling the various error messages we received to find out what went wrong when we tried to push/pull/branch. 
* We also faced challenges when implementing the additional features:
   * When attaching an image to a post, we initially had to decide on where to store the images. Also, when it was first implemented, the images were showing up as broken.
   * The upvote/downvote feature was complex and took way longer than we expected to implement
   * Using SQLite with python was also new to us and figuring out how to access the tuples in the Question table of the database and match them to the user’s input to add the search bar initially served as a challenge.
