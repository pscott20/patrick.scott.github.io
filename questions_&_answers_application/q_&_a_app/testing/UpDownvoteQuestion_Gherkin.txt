Feature: Upvote or Downvote feature


As a user, I want to be able to upvote or downvote questions and answers so I may be able to help determine relevance and accuracy of the questions or answers.


Scenario: As a user, I want to upvote or downvote questions starting from the homepage
        GIVEN I am on the homepage after logging in or registering
                WHEN I select the “All Questions” tab
THEN I am taken to the <user’s> “All Questions” page
                AND I should see a search bar
                AND I can see each Question’s “Title”
                AND I can see each Question’s “Date”
                AND I can see whether each Question has been answered or not
                AND I can see an “Edit” button
                AND I can see a “Delete” button
                AND I can see a “Report” button
                WHEN I select on a specific Question’s title
                THEN I should be taken to the Question’s specific page
                AND I should see an upvote button
                AND I should see a downvote button
                AND I should see a score
                AND I should see the title of the Question
                AND I should see the text of the Question
                AND I should see the date of the Question
                AND I should see the image corresponding to the Question (if any)
                AND I should see whether the question has been answered or not
                WHEN I select the green “Upvote” button
THEN the Score number between the “Upvote” and “Downvote” buttons should increase by 1
                WHEN I select the red “Downvote” button
THEN the Score number between the “Upvote” and “Downvote” buttons should decrease by 1
